    <p>Life is full of moments of joy, pleasure, success and comfort punctuated by misery, defeat, failures and problems. There is no human being on Earth, strong, powerful, wise or rich, who has not experienced, struggle, suffering or failure. You have to work hard to reach to the highest position.</p>

    <p>Joy, pleasure, success, and comfort are interspersed throughout life, as are agony, defeat, failures, and troubles. No human person, no matter how powerful, intelligent, or wealthy, has ever lived without struggle, suffering, or failure. To get to the top, you must put in a lot of effort.</p>
